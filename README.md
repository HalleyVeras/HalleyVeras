### Hello, there! 


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a technology enthusiast, graduated in Information Technology Management in 2011 from Faculdade dos Guararapes.

I believe that technology is one of the driving forces behind the world, and thus, I see the position of Software Developer as something essential in my professional journey. I constantly seek to improve and expand my knowledge, which led me to take an English course in Ireland, adding valuable skills to my resume.

Currently, my focus is on enhancing my skills in three distinct programming languages: Java, Python, and Rust, studying at Cesar School. Additionally, I am dedicated to learning SQL to deepen my knowledge in database management.

During my leisure time, I enjoy playing games like Dota 2, Xbox, and CS, finding a perfect balance between work and play.

I am always open to new challenges and collaboration opportunities. Therefore, feel free to explore my projects on GitHub and get in touch to discuss ideas, collaborations, or simply share experiences about technology and development.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and let's embark on this journey of learning and growing in this vast and astonishing technological universe.
